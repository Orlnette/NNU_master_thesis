	abstract = {We propose automatic contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement. We automatically set the clip point for CLAHE based on textureness of a block. Also, we introduce dual gamma correction into CLAHE to achieve contrast enhancement while preserving naturalness. First, we redistribute the histogram of the block in CLAHE based on the dynamic range of each block. Second, we perform dual gamma correction to enhance the luminance, especially in dark regions while reducing over-enhancement artifacts. Since automatic CLAHE adaptively enhances contrast in each block while boosting luminance, it is very effective in enhancing dark images and daylight ones with strong dark shadows. Moreover, automatic CLAHE is computationally efﬁcient, i.e., more than 35 frames/s at 1024 × 682 resolution, due to the independent block processing for contrast enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that automatic CLAHE with dual gamma correction achieves good performance in contrast enhancement and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and quantitative measures.},
